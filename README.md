> a game about elevators

* [DOWNLOAD CURRENT VERSION](https://github.com/Werninator/auf/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)

in **auf** you control elevator(s) to bring different people from one floor to another

it's an action-puzzle / management game

if people wait for too long, they get angry and explode

when the third person explodes, the building will be shut and your carreer as an elevator manager will end

but you can try it as often as you want with different buildings with different amounts of floors and structures
